# Snake

# ATTENTION

THIS GAME MAY HAVE BUGS, SO BEWARE!!!

# Anyways...

Hi! This is my first repository! I decided to do a game because why not. Anyways, you might know Snake. But for those of you who DON'T know Snake (or how my game works), here's a quick instruction panel below!

## Controls

Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the snake around! That's pretty much it...

## Things you're gonna want to avoid doing

Here are ways things can go wrong with Snakey. Yes, I gave him a name, so you BETTER protect my pet from the not-wanted actions I am about to tell.

### Crashing into the Wall

The wall is very dangerous. I don't want my snake crashing into that wall and getting head damage because I love Snakey. So protect him. Steer him away from the wall if he gets close.

### Crashing into himself

Now you might be thinking, "How could he be a danger to himself?" And let me tell you. I don't want Snakey getting tangled in a knot because it's hard to get him un-knotted. So yeah. PROTECT HIM!

## Objective

Every animal needs to eat, but Snakey here is always hungry! He really likes red food so always steer him to his food. Everytime he eats he grows a bit longer, so it'll get hard to get him not in knots (Get it?) But I need you to keep him a good diet, which is to eat a whole lot. He also needs a good workout, so he never stops moving (so be careful about that).

## Last words

I think I have supplied you with all the knowledge you need so take care of my pet, and I'll see you later!
